# Test Case for Benham, where Condorcet Loser Dropping
# will change outcome.
# Demonstrates a failing of IRV in general. In this Case
# there is a loop, with an additional choice which is the
# plurality winner but not in the loop. With Condorcet Loser
# Dropping the Irrelevant Choice (Condorcet Loser) is removed,
# but with IRV dropping one of the loop members is dropped instead.
