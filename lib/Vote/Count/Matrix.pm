=head1 Win-Loss Matrix

Condorcet Pairwise Methods require a Win-Loss Matrix. This object takes an RCV BallotSet with an optional Active list and returns the Matrix as an Object. The Ojbect is capable of Scoring itself, Calculating a Smith Set, and identifying Condorcet Winners and Losers.


=head1 SYNOPSIS

 
 my $Matrix =
   Vote::Count::Matrix->new(
     'BallotSet' => $myVoteCount->BallotSet() );
   my $Scores = $Matrix->ScoreMatrix();
   my %DominantSet = $Matrix->SmithSet()->%*;
   my $CondorcetWinner = $Matrix->CondorcetWinner();



=head2 new

Parameters:


=head3 BallotSet (required)

A Ballot Set reference as generated by ReadBallots, which can be retrieved from a Vote::Count object via the ->BallotSet() method.


=head3 BallotSetType (future use)

Defaults to rcv. Currently rcv is the only type supported. In the future the Matrix may be able to deal directly with Range Ballots.


=head3 Active (optional)

A hash reference with active choices as the keys. The default value is all of the choices defined in the BallotSet.


=head3 Logging (optional)

Has the logging methods of Vote::Count::Log.


=head1 Methods


=head2 MatrixTable

Returns a MarkDown formatted table with the wins losses and ties for each Active Choice as text.


=head2 PairingVotesTable

Returns a MarkDown formatted table with the votes for all of the pairings.


=head2 GetPairResult ( $A, $B )

Returns the results of the pairing of two choices as a hashref.

 
   {
    'FUDGESWIRL' =>  6,
    'loser'      =>  "STRAWBERRY",
    'margin'     =>  2,
    'STRAWBERRY' =>  4,
    'tie'        =>  0,
    'winner'     =>  "FUDGESWIRL"
   }



=head2 GetPairWinner ( $A, $B )

Returns the winner of the pairing of two choices. If there is no Winner it returns a false value (empty string).


=head2 ScoreMatrix

Returns a HashRef of the choices and their Matrix Scores. The scoring is 1 for each win, 0 for losses and ties. In the event a choice has ties but no wins their score will be .001. Where N is the number of choices, a Condorcet Winner will have a score of N-1, a Condorcet Loser will have a score of 0. Since a choice with at least one tie but no wins is not defeated by all other choices they are not a Condorcet Loser, and thus those cases are scored with a near to zero value instead of 0. Methods that wish to treat no wins but tie case as a Condorcet Loser may test for a score less than 1.


=head2 ScoreTable

Returns the ScoreMatrix as a markdown compatible table.


=head2 LeastWins

Returns an array of the choice or choices with the fewest wins.


=head2 CondorcetLoser

Eliminates all Condorcet Losers from the Matrix Object's Active list. Returns a hashref. Takes an optional true false argument (default is false) to include choices that have tied but not won in the elimination.

 
   {
     verbose => 'verbose message',
     terse   => 'terse message',
     eliminated => [ eliminated choices ],
     eliminations => number of eliminated choices,
   };



=head2 CondorcetWinner

Returns either the Condorcet Winner or an empty string if there is none.


=head2 SmithSet

Finds the innermost Smith Set (Dominant Set). [ assistance in finding proof of the algorithm used would be appreciated so it could be correctly referenced in this documentation ]. A Dominant Set is a set which defeats all choices outside of that set. The inner Smith Set is the smallest possible Dominant Set.

Returns a hashref with the keys as the choices of the Smith Set.


=head2 ResetActive

Reset Active list to the choices list of the BallotSet.


=head2 GreatestLoss

Returns the greatest loss for a choice C<<< $MyMatrix->GreatestLoss( $A ) >>>.


=head2 RankGreatestLoss

Returns a RankCount object of the Greatest Loss for each choice.
