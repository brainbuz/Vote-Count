=head2 Usage

This role is consumed by Vote::Count and Vote::Count::Matrix.

=head3 new

Has the following Attributes:

=head4 WithdrawalList

A text file containing choices 1 per line that are withdrawn. Use when a choice may be included in the ballots but should be treated as not-present. Removing a choice from the choices list in a Ballot File will generate an exception from ReadBallots if it appears on any Ballots. Withdrawing a choice will exclude it from the Active Set if it is present in the Ballots.

=head4 VoteValue

Use to set a Vote Value for methods that weight votes. The default value is 1.

=head3 Active

Get Active Set as HashRef to the active set. Changing the new HashRef will change the internal Active Set, GetActive is recommended as it will return a HashRef that is a copy instead.

=head3 GetActive

Returns a hashref containing a copy of the Active Set.

=head3 Choices

Returns an array of all of the Choices in the Ballot Set.

=head3 GetActiveList

Returns a simple array of the members of the Active Set.

=head3 ResetActive

Sets the Active Set to the full choices list of the BallotSet.

=head3 SetActive

Sets the Active Set to provided HashRef. The values to the hashref should evaluate as True.

=head3 SetActiveFromArrayRef

Same as SetActive except it takes an ArrayRef of the choices to be set as Active.

=head3 Defeat

Remove $choice from current Active List.

  $Election->Defeat( $choice );

=head3 BallotSet

Get BallotSet

=head3 GetBallots

Get just the Ballots from the BallotSet.

=head3 PairMatrix

Get a Matrix Object for the Active Set. Generated and cached on the first request.


=head3 UpdatePairMatrix

Regenerate and cache Matrix with current Active Set.


=head3 VotesCast

Returns the number of votes cast.


=head3 VotesActive

Returns the number of non-exhausted ballots based on the current Active Set.

=head3 VoteValue

Sets a VoteValue for use in weighted systems like STV. The default value is 1. Approval and TopCount are aware of VoteValue for RCV ballots.
