=head1 Synopsis

  my $RangeElection = Vote::Count->new(
    BallotSet  => read_range_ballots('t/data/tennessee.range.json')
    );
  my $scored = $RangeElection->Score();

=head1 Range Score Methods

When Range (Cardinal) Ballots are used, it is simple and obvious to total the scores provided by the voters. This contrasts to the related Borda Method which assigns scores based on position on a Ranked Ballot.

=head2 Score

Returns a RankCount Object with the choices scored using the scores set by the voters, for Range Ballots.

=cut

sub Score ( $self, $active = undef ) {
  my $depth = $self->BallotSet()->{'depth'};
  # my @Ballots = $self->BallotSet()->{'ballots'}->@*;
  $active = $self->Active() unless defined $active;
  my %scores = ( map { $_ => 0 } keys( $active->%* ) );
  for my $ballot ( $self->BallotSet()->{'ballots'}->@* ) {
    for my $choice ( keys %scores ) {
      if ( defined $ballot->{'votes'}{$choice} ) {
        $scores{$choice} += $ballot->{'count'} * $ballot->{'votes'}{$choice};
      }
    }
  }
  return Vote::Count::RankCount->Rank( \%scores );
}

=head2 RangeBallotPair

Used for pairings against Range Ballots. Used by Condorcet and STAR.

  where $I is a Vote::Count object created with a Range Ballot Set.

  my ( $countA, $countB ) = $I->RangeBallotPair( $A, $B) ;

=cut

sub RangeBallotPair ( $self, $A, $B ) {
  my $countA   = 0;
  my $countB   = 0;
  my $approval = $self->Approval();
  for my $ballot ( $self->BallotSet()->{'ballots'}->@* ) {
    my $prefA = $ballot->{'votes'}{$A} || 0;
    my $prefB = $ballot->{'votes'}{$B} || 0;
    if    ( $prefA > $prefB ) { $countA += $ballot->{'count'} }
    elsif ( $prefA < $prefB ) { $countB += $ballot->{'count'} }
    else                      { }
  }
  return ( $countA, $countB );
}
