Vote::Count::Redact

=head1 VERSION 1.213

Methods for Redacting Ballots.

=head2 Purpose

Redacting Ballots is useful for what-if analysis and identifying Later Harm effects. Compound Methods seeking to reduce Later Harm effects can also be developed using this technique.

# ABSTRACT: Methods for Redacting Vote::Count BallotSets.

use Exporter::Easy ( OK => [qw( RedactSingle RedactPair RedactBullet )], );

=head2 RedactBullet

Takes a list (array) of choices to be converted to bullet votes. Returns a modified BallotSet where all votes that had a first choice vote for a member of the list are votes for only that choice.

  my $newBallotSet = RedactBullet( $Election->BallotSet(), 'A', 'B', 'F');

=cut

sub RedactBullet ( $ballotset, @choices ) {
  my $new     = dclone($ballotset);
  my %ballots = $new->{'ballots'}->%*;
REDACTBULLETLOOP:
  for my $ballot ( keys %ballots ) {
    my @newvote = ();
    my $oldvote = $ballots{$ballot}->{'votes'}[0];
    if ( grep( /^$oldvote$/, @choices ) ) {
      $ballots{$ballot}->{'votes'} = [$oldvote];
    }
  }
  $new->{'ballots'} = \%ballots;
  return $new;
}

=head2 RedactSingle

Return a new BallotSet truncating the ballots after the given choice.

  my $newBallotSet = RedactSingle( $VoteCountObject->BallotSet(), $choice);

=cut

sub RedactSingle ( $ballotset, $A ) {
  my $new     = dclone($ballotset);
  my %ballots = $new->{'ballots'}->%*;
REDACTSINGLELOOP:
  for my $ballot ( keys %ballots ) {
    my @newvote = ();
    my @oldvote = $ballots{$ballot}{'votes'}->@*;
    while (@oldvote) {
      my $v = shift @oldvote;
      push @newvote, $v;
      if ( $v eq $A ) { @oldvote = () }
      else            { }
      $ballots{$ballot}{'votes'} = \@newvote;
    }
    $ballots{$ballot}{'votes'} = \@newvote;
  }
  $new->{'ballots'} = \%ballots;
  return $new;
}

=head2 RedactPair

For a Ballot Set and two choices, on each ballot where both appear it removes the later one and all subsequent choices, returning a completely independent new BallotSet. If the later choices were left intact, they would become votes against the redacted choices in those pairings.

  my $newBallotSet = RedactPair( $VoteCountObject->BallotSet(), 'A', 'B');

=cut

# RedactPair only alters votes involving the two choices
# The other two methods truncate after the choice.

sub RedactPair ( $ballotset, $A, $B ) {
  my $new     = dclone($ballotset);
  my %ballots = $new->{'ballots'}->%*;
REDACTPAIRLOOP:
  for my $ballot ( keys %ballots ) {
    my @newvote = ();
    my @oldvote = $ballots{$ballot}{'votes'}->@*;
    while (@oldvote) {
      my $v = shift @oldvote;
      push @newvote, $v;
      if ( $v eq $A ) {
        while (@oldvote) {
          my $u = shift @oldvote;
          # If the other redaction member is the present vote
          # truncate this vote from here on by setting oldvote to empty array.
          if ( $u eq $B ) { @oldvote = () }
          else            { push @newvote, ($u) }
        }
      }
      elsif ( $v eq $B ) {
        while (@oldvote) {
          my $u = shift @oldvote;
          # If the other redaction member is the present vote
          # truncate this vote from here on by setting oldvote to empty array.
          if ( $u eq $A ) { @oldvote = () }
          else            { push @newvote, ($u) }
        }
      }
      else { }
      $ballots{$ballot}{'votes'} = \@newvote;
    }
  }
  $new->{'ballots'} = \%ballots;
  return $new;
}
