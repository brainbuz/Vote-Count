=head1 NAME

Vote::Count::BottomRunOff

=head1 VERSION 2.01

=head2 Description

Bottom RunOff is an elimination method which takes the two lowest choices, the choice which would lose a runoff is eliminated.

=head1 Synopsis

  my $eliminate = $Election->BottomRunOff();
  # log the pairing result
  $Election->logd( $eliminate->{'runoff'} );
  # log elimination in the short log too.
  $Election->logt( "eliminated ${\ $eliminate->{'eliminate'} }.");
  # Perform the elimination
  $Election->Defeat( $eliminate->{'eliminate'} );

=head1 BottomRunOff

The TieBreakMethod must either be 'precedence' or TieBreakerFallBackPrecedence must be true or BottomRunOff will die. Takes an optional named parameter of an active set.

  my $result = $Election->BottomRunOff();
  my $result = $Election->BottomRunOff( 'active' => $active );

Orders the Choices according to Top Count and uses Precedence to resolve any equal rankings. Then conducts a runoff between the two lowest choices in the order.

The returned value is a hashref with the keys: B<eliminate>, B<continuing>, and B<runoff>, runoff describes the totals for the two choices in the runoff.

  my $ranking2 = $args{'ranking2'} ? $args{'ranking2'} : 'Precedence';

    'ranking1' => 'TopCount',
    'ranking2' => $ranking2,
    'tied'     => [ keys $active->%* ],
  );

  # pairing should never be a tie because precedence must be enabled,
  # there should be no ties in the Matrix.
