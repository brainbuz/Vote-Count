  # $chargesPerChoice and $chargedPerChoice are from Vote::Count::Charge::Cascade
  say ChargeTable( $chargesPerChoice, $chargedPerChoice );

=head2 ChargeTable

Arguments: $chargesPerChoice, $chargedPerChoice

chargesPerChoice is a HashRef with the choices as keys, and the values the charge assessed each ballot supporting the choice.

chargedPerChoice is a HashRef with the choices as keys and the values a HashRef with the keys value, count, surplus, where value is the total vote value charged for the choice, count is the number of ballots that contributed, and surplus the value above quota charged.

  my @rows = (['Choice','Charge','Value Charged', 'Votes Charged','Surplus'] );
  for my $c ( sort keys $chargesPerChoice->%* ) {
    push @rows, [
      $c, $chargesPerChoice->{$c},
      $chargedPerChoice->{$c}{'value'},
      $chargedPerChoice->{$c}{'count'},
      $chargedPerChoice->{$c}{'surplus'}
    ]
  }
  return generate_table(
      rows => \@rows,
      style => 'markdown',
      align => [qw/ l l r r r/]
      ) . "\n";
}

  my $approval = $I->Approval()->RawCount();
  my $tc = $I->TopCount();
  my $tcr = $tc->RawCount();
  my $vv = $I->VoteValue();
