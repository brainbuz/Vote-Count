# Condorcet Dropping Methods

This module implements dropping methodologies for resolving a Condorcet Matrix with no Winner. Dropping Methodologies apply a rule to either all remaining choices or to those with the least wins to select a choice for elimination.

## Basic Dropping Methods

Common Dropping Methods are: Borda Count (with all the attendant weighting issues), Approval, Plurality Loser (TopCount), and Greatest Loss. Greatest Loss is not currently available, and will likely be implemented in the SSD module if and when that is ever written.
